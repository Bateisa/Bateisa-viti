It looks like you've been given a task to create a GitLab account, create a public repository named "username-viti," and push your CloudFormation template and userdata scripts to this repository. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this:

### 1. Create a GitLab Account:

- Go to the GitLab website (https://gitlab.com/) and sign up for a new account if you don't have one.

### 2. Create a Public Repository:

- After logging in, navigate to your dashboard.

- Click on the "+" button in the upper right corner and select "New Project."

- Choose "Blank Project."

- Name the project "username-viti" and set the visibility level to "Public."

- Click on "Create project."

### 3. Push CloudFormation Template and Userdata Scripts:

Assuming you have already initialized a Git repository in your local project directory:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /d/Users/ODwner/Documents/Bateisa-viti

# Add changes to the staging area
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Upload CloudFormation template and userdata scripts"

# Set your GitLab username and email
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your GitLab Username"

# Add the GitLab repository as a remote
git remote add gitlab <GitLab Repository URL>

# Push to the GitLab repository (replace "main" with your branch name)
git push -u gitlab main
```

Make sure to replace `<GitLab Repository URL>` with the actual URL of your GitLab repository.

### 4. Share the Link:

After successfully pushing your changes, you can share the link to your GitLab repository on the GitHub ticket. The URL will typically be in the format: `https://gitlab.com/your-username/username-viti`.

Remember to replace "your-username" with your actual GitLab username.

This process assumes that you've already set up your GitLab account, initialized a Git repository in your project directory, and committed your changes locally. If you encounter any issues or have additional questions, feel free to ask!
